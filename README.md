### Pulina IRC pisg + config + theme

This is a fork of pisg (pisg.sourceforge.net) that uses a minimal layout and theme.

## Install

See the main pisg README for dependencies and installation instructions.

To work, this fork requires the layout directory be copied to the location of your pisg OutputFile.

## Modify

The `bootstrap.css` file in the layout directory uses the Cosmo theme from Bootswatch (https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch)
It can be replaced with the vanilla bootstrap css file or a modified one.

The barchart colors can be changed in `layout/style.css`.
